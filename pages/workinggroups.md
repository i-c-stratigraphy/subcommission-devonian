## Working Groups

### Devonian/Carboniferous Boundary Working Group (DCBWG)

The DCBWG was established in 2008, with the goal to redefine the GSSP for the Tournaisian (equivakent to base of the Carboniferous System), when problems both with the type section (La Serre E', Montagne Noire, France - photo) and the index fossil (Siphonodella sulcata, conodont) arose. It includes members named by the Devonian (SDS) and Carboniferous (ISCS) subcommisions.
Several meetings and workshop took place up to now, and the new GSSP is expected to be proposed in the near future.
