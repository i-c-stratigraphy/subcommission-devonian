The main objectives of the Subcommission on Devonian Stratigraphy (SDS) are:

* to develop of an internationally approved chronostratigraphical timescale for the Devonian with maximum time resolution, as part of the ICS standard global stratigraphic scale;
* to produce a stratigraphic table displaying agreed subdivision to stage and substage level marking boundaries that are defined by a GSSP.
* to promote of new and modern stratigraphical techniques and their integration into Devonian multidisciplinary schemes.
